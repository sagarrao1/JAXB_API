 to deploy code we need java ee application server but for this simple example jax-ws provides
 emdeded server which we can use to deploy basic examples
 for we need to add main method to web service class and add
 EndPOINT.publish method to publish web service
 
 public static void main(String[] args) {
	Endpoint.publish("http://localhost:8080/po", new PurchaseOrderWebService());
	System.out.println("Running .......");
}


run the application by running PurchaseOrderWebService class 
which has main method and go to web browser and open 
http://localhost:8080/po?wsdl
to see wsdl generated or not 
server PurchaseOrderWebService should in running mode so that client can 
access the web service operations below
getOrders
getOrder
removeOrder
addOrder
