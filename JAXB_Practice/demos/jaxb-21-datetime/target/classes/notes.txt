2 approaches 

1 code first and schema first apporach

1. code first approach you hava java domain classes, you want to generate xsd
you will use schemagen command from command prompt

C:\PracticeJava\JAXB_learning\JAXB_Practice\demos\jaxb-12-schemagen>mvn compile

command for schemagen

schemagen -cp target\classes -encoding UTF-8 com.sagar.jaxb.domain.PurchaseOrder


2.if you have xsd file , you want to generate java binding classes from xsd
you use xjc command from cmd

got directory where proejct is there

xjc -d src/main/java -p com.sagar.jaxb.domain -encoding UTF-8 purchaseOrder.xsd

to provide your own customization converting xsd to java classes, you create bindings.xjb file and provide 
binding file while using xjc command, so that it creates java objects accordingly

xjc -b bindings.xjb -d src/main/java -p com.sagar.jaxb.domain -encoding UTF-8 purchaseOrder.xsd

when you define package in bindings.xjb file command is

xjc -b bindings.xjb -d src/main/java -encoding UTF-8 purchaseOrder.xsd
